#diary

So this is something new I'm trying out, mainly because I'm having such a problem with staying productive. Basically it's my new format of writing diary entries. Uploading it as a GitHub Repository will give me a really nice visual, informing me how consistent I have been throughout the year. Right now it looks like this:

It's a bit shit. But I can change that 🙃 This time I'll put my soul on the line to make everything work.

[14:00] I've had a decent start to today and I plan to keep it going in that direction. I immediately started a new working session on FocusMate. But I have no idea what I wanna do lol. I think it's about time that I unofficially founded the Frostbyte Studio. I already have what I need... me, myself, and a good company name. That means February 20th 2026 is the unofficial Frostbyte Studio foundation date. Alright... what's next?

[15:00] Jeez I got caught up chatting with my cousin and everything kinda went away from me for about an hour. Ok... let's get my head back in the game. So now that I've founded Frostbyte Studio I need an AI assistant at the very least to help me get through the bulk of my work and help me execute my ideas. So the next task is to get a prompt ready for my AI assistant and I'll go from there. Also set up a proper digital work environment to the best of my abilities.

[18:00] Yesterday was a long and difficult day, that's why I'm starting out a bit late today. It turns out that I really do work much better and more efficient with a study buddy. Both FocusMate and Irene were a godsend these past few days and they've helped me so much to focus on my tasks. Funny enough having a study buddy even helps me when they are not around. Mainly because I appreciate my alone time a lot more. 

Today I want to continue my brainstorming sessions and focus on methods of generating revenue, methods of skill progression, and future prospects of the company. The next thing I wanna do immediately is to get the game assets for the Pick the Lock. There is not much of them anyway, so I want to get everything ready in one go.
