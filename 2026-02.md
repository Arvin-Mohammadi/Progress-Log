#diary 

![[Pasted image 20260213182139.png]]

So this is something new I'm trying out, mainly because I'm having such a problem with staying productive. Basically it's my new format of writing diary entries. Uploading it as a GitHub Repository will give me a really nice visual, informing me how consistent I have been throughout the year. Right now it looks like this:

It's a bit shit. But I can change that 🙃

[14:00] I've had a decent start to today and I plan to keep it going in that direction. I immediately started a new working session on FocusMate. But I have no idea what I wanna do lol. I think it's about time that I unofficially founded the Frostbyte Studio. I already have what I need... me, myself, and a good company name. That means February 20th 2026 is the unofficial Frostbyte Studio foundation date. Alright... what's next?

[15:00] Jeez I got caught up chatting with my cousin and everything kinda went away from me for about an hour. Ok... let's get my head back in the game. So now that I've founded Frostbyte Studio I need an AI assistant at the very least to help me get through the bulk of my work and help me execute my ideas. So the next task is to get a prompt ready for my AI assistant and I'll go from there. Also set up a proper digital work environment to the best of my abilities.

[18:00] Yesterday was a long and difficult day, that's why I'm starting out a bit late today. It turns out that I really do work much better and more efficient with a study buddy. Both FocusMate and Irene were a godsend these past few days and they've helped me so much to focus on my tasks. Funny enough having a study buddy even helps me when they are not around. Mainly because I appreciate my alone time a lot more. 

Today I want to continue my brainstorming sessions and focus on methods of generating revenue, methods of skill progression, and future prospects of the company. The next thing I wanna do immediately is to get the game assets for the Pick the Lock. There is not much of them anyway, so I want to get everything ready in one go.

[21:00] I spent the entirety of the first half of my day, making my physical workspace look a little bit nicer. It's all in the hopes of me psychologically preparing myself to be more lenient towards productivity rather than running away from it. It's nothing too drastic, but it is something. I always rely on my gut instincts to guide me, and my gut is telling me that the effect of all this prep work will be immense. Baby steps. 

[23:00] I made the game assets in photoshop. The next thing I have to do is naming the photoshop layers, setting up the Godot project, setting up the nodes, setting up the game script and the user-interface... nothing too crazy. I feel like the hardest thing for me right now, is overcoming that hurdle of actually making a playable game, exporting it, and uploading it to Google Play or Bazaar. That's the most difficult thing for me. Overcoming the mental pressure.

[19:30] Alrighty... I think today I'm a bit too tired to work. But I did a very good 2 hours and actually finished the main game loop. I honestly do want to continue making the game and adding more stuff to it. But I'm not feeling it today. I don't care about Frostbyte Studio. I wanna relax after so many days of intensive work, I get to do that every once in a while right? I'm only human. So... I declare the rest of the day off.

[19:45] From about 3 weeks ago, I've had so many good and productive days and it makes me happy to even think about it. I've dealt with university enrolment, research about Italy, new content in my diary, game-dev, playing games, and just had a good freaking time. But the past 3 days have been incredibly miserable. A combined productivity of 2 hours in three days, that's disgustingly bad. 

So I just wanted to go through the things that actually help me stay productive. Off the top of my head I can think of using Focusmate, not breaking focus for long periods of time throughout the day, and staying in the moment rather planning ahead. I have to write an essay about this topic and try to understand it. 

Plus I have a bunch of other random tasks, say getting a backup of my files, managing my video archive, posting a new image on Instagram, getting an update from my friends, and some other stuff, then some emailing. Literally none of the tasks on my to-do list have anything in common lmao. 

[22:00] I have to write an email for Arman to send to ArXiv since they don't let me upload my own fucking paper and I have to ask someone else to do it. So essentially they are saying that you have to provide a "justification" on why you want to publish something as a proxy. Great. 

I also have to Email the Department of Electronics, Information and Bioengineering. See what they have to say on the subject matter of me taking up the Game-Development Course, because the cunt director of the Games Lab, Pierluca Lanzi said this: 

```
Dear Arvin, 

In the game lab we only work with students who completed the course on Video Game Design and Development and possibly the Online Game Design course at UNIMI which is also available to the students attending the master in computer engineering.  

Regards,
PL
```

Funny how he says "Regards" and not "Best regards" like he sounds... ugh it was such an annoying email to receive. Specially after working up my nerve to abandon robotics and deciding to fall into the game-dev industry directly without walking sideways. 

[22:45] As it turns out, I literally can't use proxies as a way to ditch the endorsement system. What they mean by "trusted third parties" is basically journals and conferences. Not some random guy. And there must be a legitimate reason. So saying that "I wanna upload my friend's paper cause he can't get endorsed" doesn't count as LeGiTimAtE apparently. Alright fuck it. I'll upload it somewhere else. 

Edit: Change of plans. I'll wait until Arman uploads his 3rd one and endorses me. So I can upload all of my papers. It'll take 3 month for Arman to be eligible to endorse me. But yeah, that's what we'll do.

[16:00] There is a bit of ambiguity still as what I want from this project. What are my ambitions, how I view this whole thing. I want to go through some of my thoughts and plans for the company. More than anything, I want to know how I can replicate the success I had with The Second Brain Project. I basically woke up every single day for an entire year, and all I did was write diary entries and change my folder structure. That's it. An entire year went by like that. AND I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT. So I wanna see how I can replicate that dedication. 

[22:30] My next bit of work is getting back to developing the project... Tappy Tappy Circle... god I fucking loath this name. I hate myself for coming up with the name on the spot. What the actual fuck is wrong with me. In any case, I need to do a bit more paperwork, and then get to working in Godot.
