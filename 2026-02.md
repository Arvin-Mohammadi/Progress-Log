#diary

So this is something new I'm trying out, mainly because I'm having such a problem with staying productive. Basically it's my new format of writing diary entries. Uploading it as a GitHub Repository will give me a really nice visual, informing me how consistent I have been throughout the year. Right now it looks like this:

It's a bit shit. But I can change that 🙃 This time I'll put my soul on the line to make everything work.

[14:00] I've had a decent start to today and I plan to keep it going in that direction. I immediately started a new working session on FocusMate. But I have no idea what I wanna do lol. I think it's about time that I unofficially founded the Frostbyte Studio. I already have what I need... me, myself, and a good company name. That means February 20th 2026 is the unofficial Frostbyte Studio foundation date. Alright... what's next?

[15:00] Jeez I got caught up chatting with my cousin and everything kinda went away from me for about an hour. Ok... let's get my head back in the game. So now that I've founded Frostbyte Studio I need an AI assistant at the very least to help me get through the bulk of my work and help me execute my ideas. So the next task is to get a prompt ready for my AI assistant and I'll go from there. Also set up a proper digital work environment to the best of my abilities.

[18:00] I'm starting out a bit late today. So as it turns out... based on a heap of evidence, I work incredibly better while I have a study buddy. I can focus more easily and I can even relax while being focused. Honestly the web app FocusMate and Irene are both godsends at this point. So that's helping me get some serious work done, but the problem is that when there is no one to keep me company, I'm really all over the place. I can't focus, I can't start, I can't be consistent. That's something I have to work on. Focus even outside of these on and off study sessions. 

Today I wanna write about methods of generating revenue and also methods of skill progression. And of course I wanna make the game assets for Pick the Lock game. Maybe I'll change the name to something else. Open the Circle? Some shit like that. Whatever. This is finally starting to get serious. From a vanity project to a real deal. I guess it's because it's only the first time I'm seriously considering how I can make money with my current level of skills. But yeah let's see how it goes.
